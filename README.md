# "Automated Traffic Volume Estimation Using IoT-Enabled Smart Mobility Solutions
This project leverages IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time, automated traffic volume estimation for smart mobility applications. By integrating data from IoT-enabled devices, such as roadside sensors and GPS data from connected vehicles, the system continuously monitors traffic conditions. The machine learning model processes this data to predict traffic volume trends, identify congestion points, and generate actionable insights for traffic flow optimization.

The system's automation capabilities enable real-time adjustments in response to traffic changes, such as dynamic signal timing or rerouting, to improve traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Designed for smart cities, this solution aims to enhance urban mobility through data-driven insights, supporting sustainable and efficient transportation networks.
